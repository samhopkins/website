    <h1>Lakeside Dart Lab</h1>
    
    Much of this content is shamelessly stolen 
    from <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse190m/12su/labs/lab6-pimpmytext.shtml#">here</a>.
    I (Sam Hopkins) take responsibility for any errors.
    <p>
    Today you'll write a page where the user can type text into a box, and by
    clicking on UI controls, can apply various transformations to the text. The
    HTML page arrested_development.html contains (almost) all the HTML you need,
    and links to a CSS file that defines all the styles you need. You need not
    write any CSS code today.  You will write a Dart file
    arrested_development.dart that will manipulate the text.
    <ol>
      <li> Make a directory in which you will do this lab.
      <li> Download the html file <a href="arrested_development.html">here</a>
      (right-click, Save Target As...) to get started. Put it in your lab
      directory.
      <li> The Dart editor has all sorts of tools and boilerplate-automation
      that would be very useful for building a production Dart app but which we
      will basically ignore today. Open the Dart editor, and import your lab
      folder (File -- Open Folder). You should see a new folder on the left-hand
      pane which contains arrested_development.html.
      <li> Make a new Dart file, arrested_development.dart (File -- New File).
      Put it in your lab directory by selecting the lab directory in the main
      pane of the new file dialog as the parent of the new file. The editor will
      generate an empty class body for you. You can delete it or ignore it, but
      for today we're going to throw good object-oriented design out the window
      and just write some top-level functions. This is very common when writing
      small programs in scripting languages.
      <li> Add the following code to arrested_development.html. The first line
      links in your script; the second one bootstraps the browser to run Dart
      code.
      <br>
      <code>
      &lt;script type=&quot;application/dart&quot;
      src=&quot;arrested_development.dart&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      <br>    &lt;script
      src=&quot;https://dart.googlecode.com/svn/branches/bleeding_edge/dart/client/dart.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      </code>
      <li> Add a main method to arrested_development.dart. You can give it type
      <code>void</code> or leave it untyped -- up to you. In order to use Dart
      for client-side web programming, we need to import the
      <code>dart:html</code> library. At the top of arrested_development.dart,
      put the line
      <br>
      <code>import "dart:html";</code>
      <br>
      As a simple test to
      make sure the code is making it into the browser, use the
      <code>window.alert</code> method to output some sort of debug message. You
      can look up the method signature at <a href="http://api.dartlang.org">the
        api docs</a>.
      <li> Save all your files and let's run the code! Click the green circle
      with the arrow in the top control bar to run your app. This will launch
      Dartium, a special build of Chrome which runs Dart code natively.
      (To deploy a Dart application to other browsers, we would compile it to
      Javascript first.) You should see the alert popup with your debug message.
      If not, start debuggin'!
      <li> Now we'll do some basic event handling. The first thing we need to do
      is get a hold of one of the elements on the page. In
      <code>dart:html</code>, we usually get elements by querying with CSS
      selectors. In this case, we would like to get our hands on the Bananafy!
      button. Use the <code>query</code> method to get at the Bananafy! button,
      with something like the following line of code:
      <br>
      <code>var foo = query('selector');</code>
      <br>
      or, with types
      <br>
      <code>ButtonElement foo = query('selector');</code>
      </br>
      <li> Modify the code so that the alert message you made earlier doesn't
      show up until the user clicks the button. The user's button click fires an
      event in the browser, which causes the browser to run any event handlers
      that have been registered with that button. To register an event handler,
      use something like
      <br>
      <code>
        button.on.click.add(handler);
      </code>
      <br>
      where <code>handler</code> is some event-handling function. The Darty way
      to deal with a simple case like this is to use an anonymous function,
      which looks like this:
      <br>
      <code>
        button.on.click.add((e) {
          // your code here
        });
      </code>
      <br>
      Note that this is just like the syntax for a regular function, except
      we've left off the name (hence "anonymous") and the type of
      <code>e</code> (which happens to be <code>Event</code>). So if we weren't
      taking advantage of all the sexy syntax here, we could have written
      <br>
      <code>
        button.on.click.add(handler); <br>
        void handler(Event e) { // code here }
      </code>
      <br>

      <li> Let's do something useful now. We're going to make the Bananafy!
      button take the user's text and print it, but Bananafied (i.e. turned an
      awful shade of yellow). I won't give you all the code here, but here are
      some hints:
      <ul>
        <li> There is already a CSS class that has the correct presentation --
        take a look at the stylesheet that arrested_development.html links to.
        <li> To make a new, say, paragraph element in code, call the constructor
        <code> new ParagraphElement()</code>.
        <li> To add an element to the page as a child of some other element, use
        <code>element.nodes.add(child)</code>.
        <li> To set the text content of an element, use <code>element.innerHTMl
          = "content"</code>.
        <li> To get access to an element's CSS classes, use
        <code>element.classes</code>, which returns a list of classes that can
        be added to (and removed from, but we don't care about that) with
        <code>element.classes.add("foo")</code>. Alternatively, you can call
        <code>element.classes.toggle("foo")</code> (although at least until
        recently this was buggy/nonexistent).
      </ul>

      <li> Now let's implement the chocolate-dipped option: if the
      chocolate-dipped box is checked, Bananafy! should give brown text instead
      of yellow text. Two hints:
      <ul>
        <li> There's already a useful CSS style in the stylesheet defined for you.
        <li> To get a boolean that is true if a checkbox is checked and false
        otherwise, use <code>checkbox.checked</code>.
      </ul>

      <li> The last button, Four Thousand Dollar Suit, should take the input
      given and output it with "Yeah, the guy wearing the four thousand dollar
      suit is" prepended and "Come on!" appended. No hints this time, but it may
      be helpful to Google for Dart string interpolation.

      <li> Challenge problem: Arrested Development meets Charlie Kaufman. Add a
      Malkovitch button that causes each word currently in the results section
      with length more than 4 characters to be replaced by the word
      "Malkovitch".
    </ol>
